Welcome to my website. I am a fourth-year Economics Ph.D. student at the University of Oregon. I am also a freelance economist at [Vivid Economics](https://www.vivideconomics.com/), where I was an intern in the summer of 2020.

I am interested in _nearly everything_ related to economics but I focus on urban and environmental economics. My current research examines the spatial consequences of environmental policies such as carbon taxes and air quality monitoring. For coverage of a recent paper (with Mark Colas), see [this article](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/article/2020/california-green-rush) on the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis' website. At Vivid, I am part of a multi-discplinary team working on developing a global energy systems model -- where I am leading the development of the demand side of the model.

I have taught a class on [Urban Economics](https://github.com/johnmorehouse/EC330_UrbanEcon/blob/master/README.md) as the lead instructor at the University of Oregon and as well as an upper-division econometrics course. I have also TA'ed for a variety of courses ranging from principles of micro to Ph.D. macroeconomics. 

On a more personal note, I am a long-time cycling enthusiast. I am a (currently inactive) USA cycling category 2 road cyclist, and depending on the state of the COVID19 pandemic, may return to amateur road racing in 2021. I also enjoy many of the other outdoor amenities Oregon has to offer, such as skiing and hiking.
