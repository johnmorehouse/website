Welcome to my website. I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Oregon focusing on environmental and urban economics. Currently, I am a dissertation intern at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. 

Generally, I am interested in public policy questions surrounding markets with externalities. My research uses tools from various subfields in economics including structural estimation and modern causal inference techniques.

Please don't hesitate to contact me with any questions.
