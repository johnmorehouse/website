- [The Environmental Cost of Land-Use Restrictions](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Cn6OiwNJeWksrKi7WG-58th77odfNm4/view) (with [Mark Colas](https://sites.google.com/site/markyaucolas/))

_ABSTRACT_:

Carbon emissions per capita varies drastically across cities in the US. Cities with cleaner power plants and lower energy demand have stricter land use restrictions; these restrictions disincentivize people from living in the most energy efficient cities. We use a spatial equilibrium model to quantify the effect of land use regulation on residential carbon emissions. Our model features heterogeneous households, locations that vary by carbon efficiency of local power plants and the marginal benefits of energy usage, and endogenous wages and rents. A counterfactual simulation in which we relax land use restrictions in California cities to the national median leads to a 2.3% drop in national carbon emissions. The social benefit of a car- bon tax moderately outweighs the cost of the tax but leads to significant distributional consequences.
