Team meeting 9/27 notes:

paul:
what do we want out of next season?
this season: a few small victories but a lot of frustration. often beaten badly by Battley
What do we want to do next year? How do we do it? 

Paul: should we even try? we are old and distracted with kids and masters


didn't have much of a plan because first year coming out of covid. didnt execute at key moments of race

noel wants to race as long as he can. but he wants to spend time with his daughter

suggestion: 1 team ride a month for the winter
recruiting strategy?


1 sunday or 2 a month
committing early to early season races
calendar with 8 races, show up to maybe 5?
pick out some goal races 

action item: organize regular rides where we get together as a group

abstract: "Climate change has affected households around the globe, but its impacts are not homogenous across space. We first show that disadvantaged demographic groups are disproportionately exposed to climate change in the US and are less responsive in their adaptive behavior. Motivated by these findings, we develop and estimate a spatial equilibrium model of US local labor markets, allowing households to adapt to climate change by choosing where to live and, conditional on that choice, energy and housing consumption. Our results show that climate change to date has caused welfare losses 20% larger for Black households relative to white households and twice as large for the lowest income decile relative to the highest income decile. We estimate that these gaps will continue to grow under projections of the future climate. Both the populationâ€™s ex-ante distribution and differential mobility contribute to the observed disparities. We then evaluate a $3 billion place-based policy from the Inflation Reduction Act, quantifying the tradeoff between subsizing places with high climate damages and the resulting in-migration to climate-exposed areas.""
