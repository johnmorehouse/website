*Suffering (second from right) in the pro 1/2 race at the 2017 Gorge Roubaix in the Dalles, Oregon.*




I am originally from Petaluma, CA.  I received both my B.S and M.S in economics from the University of Oregon and will be graduating with a PhD 2022. I spent the Summer of 2020 with [Vivid Economics](https://www.vivideconomics.com/) as an intern and continued as a freelance economist for the remainder of the year. At Vivid, I led the development of demand projections for a global energy model. 

I started riding bikes when I was around 12 years old --- after I was diagnosed with a severe case of [sever's disease](https://www.chortho.com/common-conditions/severs-disease), which caused chronic pain until I had a surgery a few years later. I had the opportunity to participate in the [NorCal Highschool Cycling League](https://www.norcalmtb.org/) and then later got into road racing in college. 

Other than school and pedaling, I enjoy (or enjoyed, pre-pandemic), traveling, reading, and rock climbing. Recently, I have been reading a lot of economic history.
