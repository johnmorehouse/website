*Competing in the 2025 Rogue State Road Race.*




I am originally from Petaluma, CA.  I received both my B.S, M.S, and Ph.D from the University of Oregon. I am currently working at Freddie Mac. During the Summer of 2021, I was a dissertation intern at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. I spent the Summer of 2020 with [Vivid Economics](https://www.vivideconomics.com/) as an intern and continued as a freelance economist for the remainder of the year. At Vivid, I led the development of demand projections for a global energy model. 

I started riding bikes when I was around 12 years old --- after I was diagnosed with a severe case of [sever's disease](https://www.chortho.com/common-conditions/severs-disease), which caused chronic pain until I had surgery a few years later. I had the opportunity to participate in the [NorCal Highschool Cycling League](https://www.norcalmtb.org/) and then later got into road racing in college. 

Other than school and pedaling, I enjoy traveling and reading.
